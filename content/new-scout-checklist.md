title: "New Scout Checklist"
---

It takes some “stuff” to get started in Scouts. This checklist can help you make sure nothing gets overlooked.

## Things to get from the Scoutmaster:
 - Troop 3 Class B T-shirt (available for purchase, $20 each)
 - Troop 3 neckerchief (one given to scout, additional available for purchase, $12 each)
 - Neckerchief slide (one given to scout)
 - Scout BSA Handbook (recommend purchasing book cover from scout store to protect book)
 - Patrol Patch

## Official Scouts BSA uniform components to get from Scout Store:
 - Scouts BSA uniform shirt
 - Scouts BSA pants (we recommend nylon “Switchback” pants that have zip-off legs)
 - BSA belt/buckle
 - BSA uniform socks
 - BSA dark forest green shoulder loops
 - Troop 3 insignia
 - Golden Gate Council shoulder patch and World Scouting purple circle patch
 - BSA Scout hat - optional

## Things you need to do for summer camp:
 - Pay summer camp fees (you can pay in installments)
 - Thoroughly read the parent & Scout information for summer camp
 - Turn in camp medical form (A, B and C) signed by parent & doctor to Scoutmaster (by May 15th)
 - Make sure you have the items on the summer camp checklist, including complete uniform

## Helpful Tips:
 - Make sure you are on Scoutbook. All meeting invitations and announcements are sent via Scoutbook.
 - Attend monthly parent meeting on the 2nd Monday of each from 7:30 – 8:30 pm
 - Volunteer! Troop 3 has greatly benefitted from the donation of time and effort of numerous parents
and family members. It takes a village to raise a child and the more volunteers means more
activities for our scouts. Every effort is greatly appreciated; please contact any of the adult leaders. 
 - Read the Troop 3 Parent Guide and summer camp information thoroughly
 - Sign up for outings by turning in the permission slip in advance
 - Pay food money for most outings to your child's patrol leader or designated grub master
 - Your scout will need sleeping bag, sleeping pad, mess kit (plate, fork, cup), water bottle, full-size
backpack. Sleeping bag should be small and light. Do not buy tent, stove, cooking utensils.
