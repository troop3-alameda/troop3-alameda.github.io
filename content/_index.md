Troop 3 in Alameda is a friendly, child-led troop designed to support active kids. Our program emphasizes character building, leadership and life skills, community service and outdoor education while balancing school, sports and other activities.

Our troop takes on many exciting adventures through the year including multiple camping trips around the Bay Area, backpacking through Pt. Reyes, and rock wall climbing.

<span style="color: #8d2424;">Troop 3 sells the *always popular* local discount cards as its annual fundraiser. All proceeds go directly to Troop 3. We use these funds for equipment replacement, activities, rental fees for meeting, summer camp and more.
